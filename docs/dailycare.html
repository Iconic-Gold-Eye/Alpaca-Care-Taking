      <h2> Foot Care, Nail Trimming, Shearing </h2>
        <p> Some llamas and alpacas rarely need foot care, whereas others require nail trimming every 2â€“3 months. Diet, genetics, conformation, and environment likely play a role, but in any event, the feet of camelids should be examined regularly. Animals should be trained to allow their feet to be picked up and handled so that the pads, nails, and the area between the toes can be examined, cleaned, and worked on, if needed. Sedation is not needed for trimming with adequate training. Ideally, the animal should be in a chute for foot trimming, although very well-trained animals will stand still without restraint. Garden clippers and shears work well to trim nails, as do smaller foot tools designed for goats and sheep. Nails should be trimmed flush with the bottom of the pad. Occasionally, and especially with overgrown toes, quicking may occur. Although generally inconsequential, it can be uncomfortable and should be avoided. The pads should be mostly left alone although inspected for abnormalities. If the foot is extremely overgrown or misshapen, radiographs should be taken first to determine the location of the underlying bones in relation to the external structures. Problem feet should be worked on gradually, with trimming staged so as not to make the animal unduly lame or uncomfortable. Camelids maintained in overly wet areas will often develop fungal infections (thrush) and infections between the toes and on the pads. If these are identified, they require treatment in conjunction with changes in management and husbandry. Camelids often struggle with heat, and shearing off their fiber before hot weather is a necessity. Several cuts are possible, and a simple barrel cut, with fur shorn in a wide swath around the torso, is sometimes adequate, but shearing the animal entirely may be necessary for adequate comfort. Large, electric shears should be used, and specialty blades for camelids make an onerous job easier. Complications associated with shearing include lacerations that may occur where there are loose folds of skin (eg, near the axilla). These often heal uneventfully with or without suturing, although some can require antimicrobial therapy. Hot shears can lead to burns resulting in thick scabs, usually on the dorsum of the back, that may resemble wool rot. A history of shearing by a novice often helps confirm the diagnosis. Antimicrobial ointment is generally beneficial for these iatrogenic lesions, but sunburn also can occur after shearing, especially in light-skinned animals. If found in the acute stage, protection from further exposure and application of aloe vera lotion have proved useful. Later appearance of sunburned sites varies from mild peeling to ulcers. </p>
      <h2> Nutrition </h2>
        <p> Minerals are components of body tissues and fluids that work in combination with enzymes, hormones and vitamins. They work either in combination with each other or compete with each other for absorption. Some minerals actually enhance the absorption of other minerals. That is why it is important to balance the minerals specifically for llamas and alpacas. Calcium is the most abundant mineral. 98% of the calcium in the llama or alpaca is in bone tissue and is therefore critical to structure and strength. Calcium absorption is Vitamin D dependent and a lack of either one will result in retarded bone growth. The ratio of Calcium to Phosphorus in the overall diet is critical. Diets high in phosphorus and low in calcium have been linked to soft tissue calcification and bone loss. Phosphorus is the second most abundant mineral in the llama and alpaca. Many enzymes and the B Vitamins are activated only in the presence of Phosphorus. Calcium and Phosphorus are closely related. Fluctuations in one mineral will be reflected by subsequent fluctuations in the other. The natural ratio of Calcium to Phosphorus in bones and teeth is 2:1, this is an ideal ratio in the overall diet. Alfalfa and grains are higher in Calcium than the ideal 2:1 ratio; therefore, the supplementation of higher levels of Phosphorus are necessary. Potassium is used in intracellular fluid transmission. Potassium functions to maintain cellular integrity and water balance and is involved in muscle contraction and protein metabolism. Hot weather or stress may deplete potassium. Iron deficiency may be evident in a low red blood cell count. The condition of anemia will be aggravated by parasites. Magnesium is associated with tissue breakdown and cell destruction. Also helps in the formation of urea and as such is important in removing excess ammonia for the body. This helps the llama or alpaca to deal with hot weather and stress. Manganese deficiency may be caused by large amounts of calcium and phosphorus in the intestine. Signs of a deficiency are sterility and testicular degeneration, weak offspring and poor survival rates. Cobalt can replace zinc in some enzymes and participates in the biotin dependent oxalaxetate. Deficiency shows up as emaciated and anemic animals. Iodine deficiencies may include impaired physical development of the fetus, a lower basal metabolic rate and poorly formed bones. </p>
