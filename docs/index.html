    <h2> What is an alpaca? </h2> <!-- Header 2 Tag -->
    <p> Alpacas are domesticated South American members of the camel family, Camelidae, that derive from the Vicuna. Alpacas are closely related to Llamas; however, alpacas are physically smaller and herd animals (need to live and travel in groups) that predominantly bred for their fur, llamas are pack animals (labor animals). There are two types of alpacas: Huacaya and Suri. Huacaya alpacas are more common alpacas and known for their fluffy, crimpy fleece while Suri alpacas are known for their long, lustrous fleece. Baby alpacas are called cria. Alpacas are pregnant for an average of 343 days (11.5 months) but can vary between 320-375 days.  </p>
