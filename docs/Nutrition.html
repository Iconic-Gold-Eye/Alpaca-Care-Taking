      <h1> Nutrition </h1>
        <p> Alpacas are herbivores, primarily gazing on grasses and plants. They have a unique microbial fermentation process in their 4-chambered stomach. Their digestive system allows tough  and fibrous plants, but they should not be fed with rich and fatty foods because it could ruin their delicate digestive balance. It is also important to feed them with appropriate supplements for their good health.  </p>
      <h2> Essentials </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Forage: Grass and Hey, Grasing </li>
        <li>  Water </li>
        <li> Supplements: Minerals, Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Cobalt, Iodine, and Copper.  </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Pay attention to </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Crias (baby alpacas)-They rely on their motherâ€™s milk for their first 3 months. They will start to graze and eat hay as they grow. </li>
        <li> Pregnant Alpacas- They need higher nutrition. Ensure they have access to high-quality forage and supplements. </li>
        <li> Older Alpacas-They may have dental issues that make chewing difficult. Providing softer, more easily digestible forage and supplements is helpful. </li>
      </ul>
