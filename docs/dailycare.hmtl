      <h2> Foot Care, Nail Trimming, Shearing </h2>
        <p> The  need for footcare varies between each alpaca. Alpacas should be trained so they can allow their feet to be picked and handled. They should stand still without being restrained. Use grass clippers or shears. Nails should be trimmed flush with the bottom of the pad. Do not use hot shears as they can lead to burns </p>
      <h2> Nutrition </h2>
