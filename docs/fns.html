    <h1> Foot Care, Nail Trimming, Shearing </h1>
    <h2> Foot Care/Nail Trimming </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Alpaca nails must be trimmed every 2-4 months for health and comfort because if you do not, it can cause the alpaca to have discomfort, walk unevenly, have joint problems, have pad growth into the nails, lameness, and give them a higher chance of bleeding. </li>
      <li> Alpaca nails are made of keratin, not hooves </li>
      <li> Each foot has two big nails </li>
      <li> Signs of nails being overgrown are weird walking, reluctance to move, nails spreading or curling, and being slow. </li>
    </ul>
  <h2> Shearing </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Alpacas are shaved once a year </li>
    <li> Alpaca fleece must be sheared for their health because it prevents overheating, skin infections, and pest infestations. </li>
    <li> Alpacas can lose about 12-35 pounds of fleece after getting sheared </li>
    <li> Alpaca fur is turned into pillows, clothes, jackets, hats, gloves, and more! </li>
    <li> Alpacas are tied up over a mat and flipped to their side </li>
    <li> During shearing, the fur is divided into three bags called firsts, seconds, and thirds. Firsts are the softest fur, used for clothing that comes in contact with skin. Seconds are soft, but too coarse to be in contact with skin, used to make items like rugs and fiber arts. Thirds are short and coarse, and can be used in crafts and dryer balls. Firsts are the biggest amount and thirds are the smallest. </li>
    <li> It costs $30-$60 to get someone to shear your alpacas </li>
    <li> Alpaca fleece is sold at a price of 2-5 dollars per ounce </li>
  </ul>
