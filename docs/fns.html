    <h1> Foot Care/Nail Trimming </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Alpaca nails must be trimmed every 2-4 months for health and comfort because if you do not, it can cause the alpaca to have discomfort, walk unevenly, have joint problems, have pad growth into the nails, lameness, and give them a higher chance of bleeding. </li>
      <li> Alpaca nails are made of keratin, not hooves </li>
      <li> Each foot has two big nails </li>
      <li> Signs of nails being overgrown are weird walking, reluctance to move, nails spreading or curling, and being slow. </li>
    </ul>
