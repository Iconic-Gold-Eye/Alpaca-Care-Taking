      <h1> Tuberculosis (TB) </h1>
      <br>
      <h2> Causes </h2>
      <p> Alpacas are infected with TB when Mycobacterium Tuberculosis is transmitted to an alpaca through the air. </p>
      <h2> Note </h2>
      <p> Sometimes, sudden death does occur and symptoms may be subtle. </p> 
      <h2> Symptoms </h2>
      <p> See your veteranarian immediately for treatment if your camelid has the following symptoms </p>
      <ul>
          <li> Lethargy </li>
          <li> Self-isolation from herd </li>
          <li> Weight loss </li>
          <li> Coughing </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Treatment </h2>
      <p> The standard treatment for alpacas with TB is euthanization as there is no known cure to TB for alpacas. If euthanization is not neccessary, then move the alpaca away from the herd and test all of your animals for TB. </p>
